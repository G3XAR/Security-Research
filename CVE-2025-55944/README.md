# CVE-2025-55944: Stored XSS in Slink (v1.4.9 – v1.6.3)

## Overview
**Service:** Slink  
**CVSS Score:** 5.4 (context-dependent)  
**Description:** XSS via crafted SVG uploads  
**Affected Versions:** v1.4.9, v1.5.1, and v1.6.3


## Technical Summary
A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in Slink, a self-hosted image sharing platform.  
The application does not properly sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing attackers to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.  
When a user views the image, the script executes in the context of their browser. The attack surface includes unauthenticated visitors, and exploitation requires only that a user views a shared SVG image.  
 
Although Slink is typically deployed in private or restricted environments, its flexibility can expose it to broader networks, either intentionally or accidentally. If an attacker gains access to the internal network, or if the platform is deployed in a public-facing setup, this vulnerability could be exploited.


## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a malicious SVG file with embedded JavaScript.  
2. Log in to Slink and upload the SVG via the standard image upload interface.  
3. Share the direct link.  
4. The embedded script executes automatically when the image is opened—no login required.
