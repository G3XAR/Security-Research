# CVE-2026-27198: Broken Access Control

| Property | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Service** | Formwork |
| **CVSS Score** | 8.8 (High) |
| **Published** | February 19, 2026 |
| **Description** | Improper Privilege Management in User creation |
| **Affected** | `>=2.0.0`, `<=2.3.3` |
| **Patched** | `2.3.4` |


## Technical Summary

The application improperly enforces role-based authorization during account creation. While the system verifies that a requested role exists, it does not validate whether the requesting user has sufficient privileges to assign high-privileged roles such as `admin`.

By default, the `editor` role includes the `panel.users: true` permission (defined in `site/users/roles/editor.yaml`), granting access to user management functionality. Due to missing server-side authorization checks on the role parameter during account creation, an authenticated user with the `editor` role can create a new account with `admin` privileges.

Successful exploitation results in full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS.

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in to the Formwork Panel with an account that has the Editor role.
2. Navigate to the Users section.
3. Click "New User".
4. In the role selection field, choose Admin.
5. Complete the account creation process.
6. Log in using the newly created account.

### Impact

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:

- Gain full administrative control over the CMS.
- Access all site data and user information.
- Modify system configuration and security settings.
- Create, modify, or delete any user account, including legitimate administrators.
